/** Disable all RADSan error reporting.

    This method might be useful to you if RADSan is presenting you with an error
    for some code you are confident is realtime safe. For example, you might
    know that a mutex is never contested, and that locking it will never block
    on your particular system. Be careful!

    A call to `radsan_off()` MUST be paired with a corresponding `radsan_on()`
    to reactivate interception after the code in question. If you don't, radsan
    will cease to work.

    Example:

        [[clang::nonblocking]] float process (float x)
        {
            auto const y = 2.0f * x;

            radsan_off();
            i_know_this_method_is_realtime_safe_but_radsan_complains_about_it();
            radsan_on();
        }

*/

/** Re-enable all RADSan error reporting.

    The counterpart to `radsan_off`. See the description for `radsan_off` for
    details about how to use this method.
